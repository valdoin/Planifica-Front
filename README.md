# Planifica

[Server repo](https://github.com/valdoin/Planifica-Back)

Planifica is a scheduling web app built using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.js).

It allows you to add, delete, edit, and import attendees and events via .csv files.

You can then view these events on a calendar (made thanks to the Vue.js [Qalendar Component](https://tomosterlund.github.io/qalendar/)) and export this calendar in ICS format.
